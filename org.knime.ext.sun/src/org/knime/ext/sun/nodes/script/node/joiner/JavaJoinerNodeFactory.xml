        <intro>
	        <p>
              Java Snippet based Joiner. Use the Java editor to enter a
              boolean expression that is used to define whether two rows are joined, 
              whereby <tt>true</tt> defines a match, 
              i.e. the currently processed left and right rows will be joined.
            </p>
		</intro>
        <option name="Column List">
          The list contains the columns that are available from both input tables.
          Double click any of the column names to insert the respective field
          in the expression editor. It will replace your current selection or
          simply insert at the current caret position.
        </option>
        <option name="Flow Variable List">
          The list contains the flow variables that are currently available at
          the node input. Double clicking any of the entries will insert the
          respective identifier at the current cursor position (replacing the
          selection, if any).
        </option>
        <option name="Global Variable Declaration">
          Define global variables here. These variables are available during 
          the execution and they are also modifiable. Names starting with '_'
          (underscore) are discouraged due to potential name conflicts with 
          internally used variables.
        </option>
        <option name="Method Body">
          Enter your java code here (the entire source will be wrapped in a
          method). You can add the name of a variables 
          by double-clicking its name in the left list. Note that numeric 
          (double-compatible) variables will be handled as <tt>Double</tt>,
          int-compatible variables as <tt>Integer</tt> and any other variable
          type as <tt>String</tt>. 
        </option>
